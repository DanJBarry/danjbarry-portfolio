    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I'm a software engineer based in Central New Jersey, with a passion for
        building secure, scalable systems. I grew up in Buffalo, New York, where
        my interest in software engineering started after taking a Java class in
        high school. I graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with a
        B.S. in Computer Science and have spent the past five years working on
        backend systems, most recently in the world of Identity and Access
        Management.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>

    <p>
        My primary focus is on building secure authentication and authorization
        systems. I work extensively with OAuth 2.0, Auth0, and microservices
        architectures. I've designed REST APIs that handle hundreds of thousands
        of requests and built systems that power recruitment platforms used by
        companies worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy the challenge of making complex systems reliable and efficient.
        Whether it's reducing token exchanges through smart rate limiting,
        optimizing database queries, or automating deployment pipelines, I'm
        always looking for ways to improve performance and developer experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>
        Outside of my professional work, I've dabbled in several languages, such
        as Rust and Go, by working on side projects. Occasionally, these
        projects make it past the idea stage and land on my

    <h2>Beyond Code</h2>

    <p>
        I'm a retired competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee player. I competed in
        the Tristate region as

        >, maining Sheik and Zelda across 20 tournaments. The competitive
        mindset and analytical thinking from Melee continue to influence how I
        approach problem-solving in software engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
        These days, I channel my competitive energy into volleyball. I actively
        compete in indoor, sand doubles, and grass doubles tournaments and
        leagues throughout New Jersey.
